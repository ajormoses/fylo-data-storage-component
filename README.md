- [Overview](#overview)
  My name is Ajor Moses, i'm new on this platform and i'm open to learning and improvement, Thanks for checking out my front-end coding challenge.

  - [The challenge](#the-challenge)
  My challenge is to build out this data storage component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. The only assets that was provided in this challenge are the icons present in my design, Everything else was created using HTML & CSS!

  - [Screenshot](#screenshot)
  You will find all the required assets in the `/images` and `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

- [My process](#my-process)
    1. I started by looking through the designs to start planning out how i will tackle the project. 
    2. Before adding any styles in my css file, i made sure i structure the content in my HTML file. Writing my HTML first helped me to focus my attention on creating well-structured content.
    3. I started adding styles to the top of the page and work down and also i moved on to the next section once i'm satisfied with the area i finished working on.
    4. After working on the structure and design, my last work was to make my design responsive and also to have different design for different screen size using media query.
